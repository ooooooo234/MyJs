About this extension


* Click the add-on icon to write your own JavaScript.
* You can save 10 JavaScripts (click the checkboxes 1~10 below and then click the overwrite button to save it).
* Please use it in the Context Menu of the web page (which appears when you click the right mouse button).



I added a JavaScript to the menu in advance, and I am using it. Its function is to let you try to use JavaScript to full screen, you can use it or ignore it.

 -----
* You can use it directly in firefox addons : <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/myjs/">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/myjs/</a>
* You can also copy the code and use it in chrome
* Because the code parameter names supported by Firefox and chrome are different, the related unparseable parameter warning will be displayed on the debug page. But this will not affect any functions.
